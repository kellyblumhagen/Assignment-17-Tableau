# Tableau Bike Rental

Since 2013, the [Citi Bike Program](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citi_Bike) has implemented a robust infrastructure for collecting data on the program's utilization. Through the team's efforts, each month bike data is collected, organized, and made public on the [Citi Bike Data](https://www.citibikenyc.com/system-data) webpage. However, while the data has been regularly updated, the team has yet to implement a dashboard or sophisticated reporting process. 

This project requires the aggregation of data found in the Citi Bike Trip History Logs to build a Tableau dashboard for all rides taken in 2018. The final dashboard contains analyses on trends such as popularity of starting and ending stations, rental patterns over time, and biker demographics. Data and analysis are presented in a way that is focused, concise, easy-to-understand, and visually compelling.
